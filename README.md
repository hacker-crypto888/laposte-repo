# My Hacking Project

## My Hacking Criterias

I'll use this section to tell people about which parts of my app are the result of my hacking project.
I'll use a chart to tell people about what features or software versions are supported by my application.

| Software        | Supported          | 
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| lxd lxc         | :white_check_mark: |
| github          | :white_check_mark: |
| jenkins         | :white_check_mark: |
| azure microsoft | :x:                |
| docker          | :x:                |
| VirtualBox      | :x:                |

A second chart will tell people about what devices the application has and has not been adapted to.
